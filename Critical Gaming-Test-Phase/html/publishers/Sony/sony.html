            Sony Interactive Entertainment is a Japanese-American multinational video game and digital entertainment company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of conglomerate Sony Corporation. SIE includes two companies, one based in America and the other based in Japan. Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (SIE LLC), based in San Mateo, California, United States,
             was founded in April 2016 (originally founded in May 1995 as Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. in Foster City, California, United States), and is managed through Sony's American hub, Sony Corporation of America.
             Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (SIE Inc.) is based in Tokyo, Japan, and was founded as Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI or SCE) in November 1993 to handle Sony's venture into video game development for the PlayStation systems.

            Since the launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, the company has been developing PlayStation home video game consoles, accessories and services lineup. After expanding from Japan into North America and Europe, the company quickly became Sony's main resource for research and development in video games and interactive entertainment.
            In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment International was restructured and reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies. The same year, SIE LLC was established, with its headquarters in San Mateo, California.Sony Interactive Entertainment handles the research and development,
            production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation video game systems. SIE is also a developer and publisher of video game titles, and operates several subsidiaries in Sony's largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia. By August 2018, the company had sold more than 525 million PlayStation consoles worldwide.
