      Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct
      game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a
      cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects
      with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100
      players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to
      create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as early access titles and
      Creative was released on December 6, 2018. <br> Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and
      Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for those platforms, in addition for Nintendo Switch, iOS and
      Android devices.
