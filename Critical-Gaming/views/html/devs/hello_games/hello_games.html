      Hello Games was founded in February 2008 by Sean Murray and Grant Duncan, together with friends Ryan Doyle and David Ream.
       At the 2010 Develop Awards, they won two awards: Best New Studio and Best Micro Studio. In September 2010, they were listed by The Guardian as one of the 100 most innovative and creative companies of the previous 12 months.
       At the 2011 Gamescom press event, they announced their second game, Joe Danger 2: The Movie. Hello Games announced a new science fiction adventure game, titled No Man's Sky, at the VGX 2013 award show.
       On 24 December 2013, the studio's offices were flooded after a nearby river broke its bank, with much of the hardware used in the development of the game being destroyed.

      Originally, No Man's Sky had been set for release in June 2016, but a month prior, Murray announced that the game had been delayed due to need for last minute fixes and polishing,
       and would launch two months later in August. After the release of No Man's Sky, Hello Games was accused of dishonesty surrounding their promotion of the game, and the subsequent
       lack of promised features. Many of these missing features were added via numerous post-release updates.
      At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Hello Games announced Hello Labs, an initiative to fund multiple experimental and procedural generation projects. At The Game Awards 2018, Hello Games announced a new game, The Last Campfire.
